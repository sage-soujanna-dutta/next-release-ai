# Generate HTML Report Tool Fix - Complete

## Problem
The `generate_html_report` MCP tool was failing with the error:
```
‚ùå Failed to generate HTML report: Service not found: htmlFormatter
```

## Root Cause
The tool was trying to access an `htmlFormatter` service that wasn't registered in the ServiceRegistry in `/src/core/MCPToolFactory.ts`.

## Solution

### 1. Added HtmlFormatter Service Registration
- **File:** `/src/core/MCPToolFactory.ts`
- **Change:** Added `import { HtmlFormatter } from "../utils/HtmlFormatter.js";`
- **Change:** Added `this.services.register('htmlFormatter', new HtmlFormatter());` to the service initialization

### 2. Fixed Tool Implementation
- **File:** `/src/core/factories/IntegrationToolsFactory.ts`
- **Change:** Rebuilt the `createHtmlReportGeneratorTool()` method with:
  - Simplified class structure to avoid TypeScript compilation issues
  - Self-contained HTML generation methods
  - Support for multiple report types: `sprint_analysis`, `velocity_report`, `release_notes`, `team_metrics`
  - Professional CSS styling with responsive design
  - Proper data section rendering for different report types

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- **Professional HTML Templates** with modern styling
- **Dynamic Content Rendering** based on data structure
- **Metrics Grid Layout** for key performance indicators
- **Status Indicators** with color coding (good/warning/error)
- **Responsive Design** for different screen sizes
- **Multiple Report Types** support
- **Fallback Data Display** for unstructured data
