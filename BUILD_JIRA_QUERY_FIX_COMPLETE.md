# Build JIRA Query Tool Fix - Complete

## Problem
The `build_jira_query` MCP tool was failing with the error:
```
‚ùå Failed to build/execute JQL query: jiraService.buildJQLQuery is not a function
```

## Root Cause
The `JiraService` class was missing two critical methods that the `build_jira_query` tool was trying to call:
- `buildJQLQuery()` - for constructing JQL queries from criteria objects
- `fetchIssuesByJQL()` - for executing JQL queries against JIRA

## Solution
Added both missing methods to `/src/services/JiraService.ts`:

### 1. `buildJQLQuery()` Method
- Accepts criteria object with fields like project, sprint, status, assignee, etc.
- Converts criteria to proper JQL syntax
- Handles both single values and arrays
- Supports custom fields and date ranges
- Adds ORDER BY clause

### 2. `fetchIssuesByJQL()` Method  
- Executes JQL queries against JIRA REST API
- Returns normalized `JiraIssue[]` objects
- Handles story points from multiple custom fields
- Includes proper error handling and logging

## Features Supported
The tool now supports building JQL queries with:
- **project** - Project key (e.g., "SCNT")
- **sprint** - Sprint name/number (e.g., "SCNT-2025-20")
- **status** - Single or multiple statuses (e.g., ["Done", "In Progress"])
- **assignee** - Single or multiple assignees
- **issuetype/type** - Issue types (e.g., ["Story", "Bug"])
- **priority** - Priority levels
- **components** - Component names
- **created/updated** - Date ranges with after/before
- **Custom fields** - Basic support for custom field queries

## Usage Examples

### Generate JQL Only
```javascript
{
  "criteria": {
    "project": "SCNT",
    "sprint": "SCNT-2025-20", 
    "status": ["Done", "In Progress"]
  },
  "returnJQL": true,
  "orderBy": "priority"
}
```

### Execute Query (requires JIRA auth)
```javascript
{
  "criteria": {
    "project": "SCNT",
    "assignee": "john.doe",
    "priority": ["High", "Critical"]
  },
  "returnJQL": false,
  "maxResults": 50
}
```

## Verification
‚úÖ Tool successfully generates complex JQL queries  
‚úÖ Handles multiple criteria types and arrays  
‚úÖ Proper error handling and validation  
‚úÖ Returns user-friendly formatted results  
‚úÖ Integration with existing MCP infrastructure  

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/JiraService.ts` - Added `buildJQLQuery()` and `fetchIssuesByJQL()` methods

## Status
üéâ **COMPLETED** - The `build_jira_query` MCP tool is now fully functional and ready for use.
