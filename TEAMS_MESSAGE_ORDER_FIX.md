# Teams Message Structure Optimization Summary

## Updated Message Order (Top to Bottom)

### ✅ **FIXED:** Sprint Analysis Now at Top

**New Order:**
1. **📊 Sprint Executive Summary** (TOP - Most Important)
   - Completion rate, story points, commits, release date
   - Key performance metrics immediately visible

2. **🎯 Key Achievements** (Second Priority)
   - Major accomplishments with proper indentation
   - Success highlights for stakeholders

3. **🏗️ Work Summary** (Third Priority) 
   - Breakdown of completed work types
   - Features, implementation, quality focus

4. **🚀 Next Actions** (Fourth Priority)
   - Clear action items with ownership
   - Timeline for follow-up activities

5. **📁 Footer Information** (Bottom)
   - File paths, generation timestamp, status

## Problem Solved

### Before Fix:
- Sprint analysis appeared at bottom of message
- Users had to scroll to see key metrics
- Important information was buried

### After Fix:
- Sprint analysis (Executive Summary) now appears at TOP
- Key metrics are immediately visible
- Stakeholders see performance data first
