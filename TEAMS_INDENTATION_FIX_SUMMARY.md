# Teams Notification Indentation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The key achievements in Teams notifications were not properly indented, causing formatting issues where bullet points appeared flush against the left margin instead of being properly nested under their section headers.

## Root Cause
In the `ProfessionalTeamsTemplateService.ts` file, the `generateAchievementsSection()` method was generating achievement items without proper indentation:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect formatting)
${achievements.map(achievement => `âœ… ${achievement}`).join('\n')}
```

## Solution Applied
Updated the `generateAchievementsSection()` method to include proper 4-space indentation for Teams compatibility:

```typescript
// After (correct formatting with indentation)
${achievements.map(achievement => `    âœ… ${achievement}`).join('\n')}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. ProfessionalTeamsTemplateService.ts
- **Location**: `/src/services/ProfessionalTeamsTemplateService.ts`
- **Method**: `generateAchievementsSection()`

- **Location**: `/table-teams-notification.ts`
