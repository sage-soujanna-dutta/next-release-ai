# MCP Commands Instruction Set

This document provides a comprehensive guide to all available MCP (Model Context Protocol) commands for the Release Notes MCP Server. These commands can be used with VS Code Copilot for automated release notes generation.

## üåü Key Features

- **Sprint-Based Date Fetching**: When a sprint number is provided, the system automatically fetches the actual sprint start and end dates from JIRA and retrieves GitHub commits for that specific period, ensuring accurate commit tracking for the sprint duration.
- **Automatic Fallback**: If sprint dates are unavailable, the system falls back to fetching commits from the last 8 days.
- **Confluence Compatibility**: HTML output is automatically formatted for Confluence's storage format when publishing, with simplified styling that works within Confluence's constraints.
- **Dual Output**: Supports both file-based and Confluence publishing in a single workflow.
- **Rich HTML Formatting**: Generated HTML includes modern CSS styling, responsive design, and detailed statistics for local file viewing.
