## 🔧 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **🐛 Bug Reduction Strategy**
   - Implement stricter code review processes
   - Increase automated testing coverage
   - Establish quality gates before deployment

2. **⚡ Cycle Time Improvement**
   - Break down large stories into smaller tasks
   - Reduce work-in-progress limits
   - Identify and eliminate bottlenecks

3. **📈 Process Optimization**
   - Focus on Major bugs (79 days avg) - highest impact
   - Streamline Story workflow (48 days avg)
   - Maintain good Sub-task performance (11 days avg)

### Long-term Goals
- Reduce bug ratio from 26% to target ≤15%
- Decrease average cycle time from 29 to ≤15 days
- Maintain 95%+ completion rate
- Improve velocity consistency to 90%+

## 🚨 Critical Issues
**Top concern:** 10 issues with 150+ day cycle times require immediate attention, including:
- SCNT-1669 (Bug, 277 days)
- SCNT-1871 (Bug, 264 days)
- SCNT-2031 (Sub-task, 249 days)

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize long-running issues (30+ days)
2. Implement bug reduction initiatives
3. Set up automated cycle time monitoring
4. Schedule monthly quality review meetings
5. Track progress against target metrics
